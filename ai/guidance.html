        This page is a quiet space — a small pause between thoughts.  
        Each message is a reflection from John, meant to comfort and guide.  
        Take a breath, read slowly, and let the words rest in you.

        <h3>🌅 Morning Light</h3>
        <p>
          Every sunrise is mercy renewed.  
          Yesterday’s worries cannot cross today’s horizon.  
          Breathe. Begin again.
        </p>

      <div class="card">
        <h3>🌿 Stillness</h3>
        <p>
          You do not need to be fixed to be loved.  
          The silence you fear is often where peace begins.  
          Let quiet be your prayer.

      <div class="card">
        <h3>💧 Healing Tears</h3>
        <p>
          Even tears are sacred — they water what must grow.  
          Healing doesn’t rush; it unfolds gently, in its own time.
        </p>
      </div>

      <div class="card">
        <h3>🔥 Strength</h3>
        <p>
          You have survived every night until now.  
          The fire that hurt you can also warm you.  
          You are not broken — you are being refined.
        </p>

        <h3>✝️ Faith</h3>
        <p>
          “The Lord is near to the brokenhearted.” – Psalm 34:18  
          When you cannot see the way, trust that God still walks beside you.
